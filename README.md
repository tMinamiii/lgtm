## Usage

### CLI Tool

LGTM is a CLI tool that embeds custom text on images with customizable colors.
It can also embed a gopher image and outputs the result as a JPEG file.
By default, it embeds "LGTM" as main text and "Looks Good To Me" as sub-text.
You can customize both using the --text and --sub-text flags.

Usage:
  lgtm [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --color string      text color: 'white' or 'black' (optional) (default "white")
      --gopher            embed gopher image instead of text (optional)
  -h, --help              help for lgtm
  -i, --input string      input image path (required)
  -o, --output string     output file path (optional, default: current directory with auto-generated filename)
  -s, --sub-text string   custom sub-text to embed (optional, default: 'Looks Good To Me')
  -t, --text string       custom text to embed (optional, default: 'LGTM')
```

#### CLI Examples

Output `image-lgtm.jpeg` in the current directory when run below command.

```sh
# Basic usage (embeds "LGTM" and "Looks Good To Me")
lgtm -i image.jpeg

# With custom main text only
lgtm -i image.jpeg -t "Hello World"

# With custom sub-text only
lgtm -i image.jpeg -s "Custom subtitle"

# With both custom main and sub-text
lgtm -i image.jpeg -t "Hello" -s "World"

# With custom color
lgtm -i image.jpeg -c black -t "Custom Text" -s "Custom Sub"

# With custom output path
lgtm -i image.jpeg -o output.jpg -t "My Text" -s "My Subtitle"

# Gopher mode
lgtm -i image.jpeg --gopher
```

### Go Library

You can also use lgtm as a Go library in your projects:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/tMinamiii/lgtm"
)

func main() {
    // Text mode with custom text
    mainText := lgtm.NewMainText("Hello", lgtm.TextColorWhite)
    subText := lgtm.NewSubText("World", lgtm.TextColorWhite)
    drawer := lgtm.NewTextDrawer(mainText, subText, "input.jpg", "output.jpg")
    if err := drawer.Draw(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Gopher mode
    gopherDrawer := lgtm.NewGopherDrawer("input.jpg", "output-gopher.jpg")
    if err := gopherDrawer.Draw(); err != nil {
