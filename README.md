## Installation

go install github.com/tMinamiii/lgtm@latest
```

## Usage

```sh
lgtm --help

LGTM is a CLI tool that embeds custom text on images with customizable colors.
It can also embed a gopher image and outputs the result as a JPEG file.
By default, it embeds "LGTM" as main text and "Looks Good To Me" as sub-text.
You can customize both using the --text and --sub-text flags.

Usage:
  lgtm [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --color string      text color: 'white' or 'black' (optional) (default "white")
      --gopher            embed gopher image instead of text (optional)
  -h, --help              help for lgtm
  -i, --input string      input image path (required)
  -o, --output string     output file path (optional, default: current directory with auto-generated filename)
  -s, --sub-text string   custom sub-text to embed (optional, default: 'Looks Good To Me')
  -t, --text string       custom text to embed (optional, default: 'LGTM')
```

### Examples

Output `image-lgtm.jpeg` in the current directory when run below command.

```sh
# Basic usage (embeds "LGTM" and "Looks Good To Me")
lgtm -i image.jpeg

# With custom main text only
lgtm -i image.jpeg -t "Hello World"

# With custom sub-text only
lgtm -i image.jpeg -s "Custom subtitle"

# With both custom main and sub-text
lgtm -i image.jpeg -t "Hello" -s "World"

# With custom color
lgtm -i image.jpeg -c black -t "Custom Text" -s "Custom Sub"
